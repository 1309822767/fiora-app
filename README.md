Android can be compiled directly into apk, reference: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/distribution/building-standalone-apps/   
If you have a developer certificate, you can compile it into ipa. Refer to the Android build documentation. If you don't have a certificate, send it to expo like me, and then share the expo account to access it.
